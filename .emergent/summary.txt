The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack AI trading agent MVP, iteratively adding features based on user feedback. Initially, it provided AI-powered buy/sell recommendations for Indian stocks using Yahoo Finance and OpenAI GPT-5. Key enhancements included a stock search/add function (with offline fallback), a robust user authentication system (email/password, then Google login with JWT) and a user profile to configure AI models and API keys (session-based). Alerting via Telegram was integrated, alongside a paper portfolio for watchlist and analysis history. Significant effort was dedicated to a dynamic Strategy Builder for Indian stocks, allowing users to define strategies via filters (risk, horizon, RSI, sectors) and allocation. Numerous backend errors, primarily related to Python/Pandas logic and OpenAI API calls, were debugged and fixed. The project evolved from a basic recommendation engine to a highly configurable, authenticated platform. The most recent task involves fixing a profile setting not working bug after Google login.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an AI-powered trading agent capable of tracking stocks, mutual funds, and commodities, providing buy/sell recommendations with reasoning. The primary AI is OpenAI GPT-5 (latest model), and data should initially come from Yahoo Finance, focusing on weekly Indian stock market data with real-time alerts. User authentication was initially optional, then specified as simple email/password (JWT), with a subsequent request for Google login.

Key features implemented include:
- AI-powered buy/sell recommendations with confidence scores for Indian tickers (e.g., RELIANCE.NS).
- Real-time alerts (polling-based, 60s interval initially) with Telegram integration (Buy >= 80, Sell >= 60 confidence).
- Stock search and add functionality with autocomplete and an offline fallback for Indian tickers.
- User authentication (email/password JWT and Google OAuth).
- A Profile page for users to select LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), models, and enter session-based API keys.
- Persistence of user watchlist, analysis history, and UI preferences (timeframe, market, live alerts) in  and server-side.
- Dynamic Strategy Builder for Indian stocks only, allowing users to define strategies based on investment horizon, risk tolerance, RSI, sectors (IT, Banking, Auto, Pharma, FMCG, Energy, Metals), market-cap allocation (large/mid/smallcap), and a free-text prompt, picking only stocks.
- Backend support for data source toggle (Yahoo/MSN, with MSN falling back to Yahoo).
- Alert frequency, quiet hours, and per-symbol alert thresholds.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


- **/app/backend/server.py**:
    - **Summary**: Main FastAPI application handling all backend logic, API routes, database interactions, LLM integrations, and financial data processing. It's the central hub for data fetching, analysis, authentication, user profile management, alert triggering, and strategy building.
    - **Changes**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the trajectory.
        - Initial implementation: FastAPI app, MongoDB connection, CORS, basic /health endpoint.
        - Core AI features: Added ,  endpoints for trading recommendations, integrating  and OpenAI.
        - Bug fixes: Corrected Pandas data shape issues (RSI, MACD, SMA calculations), scalar handling.
        - Authentication: Implemented , ,  with JWT.
        - Profile and LLM settings: Added  GET/PUT to store user's preferred LLM provider/model.
        - Search: Implemented  with Yahoo Finance lookup and offline fallback.
        - Google OAuth: Added  and  endpoints.
        - Portfolio: Added  GET/PUT and  GET.
        - Telegram Alerts: Implemented  POST/GET,  POST, and a background alert loop.
        - Strategy Builder: Added  for dynamic strategy generation, including filters, allocation, and sector mapping.
        - Bug fixes: Indentation errors, missing imports (),  in router setup.
- **/app/backend/data/india_tickers.json**:
    - **Summary**: A JSON file used for offline lookup of Indian stock tickers, providing a fallback for the search functionality when Yahoo Finance API experiences rate limits.
    - **Changes**: Created and populated with a list of Indian stock data.
- **/app/backend/data/india_sectors.json**:
    - **Summary**: A JSON file containing mappings of Indian stocks to their respective sectors, used by the Strategy Builder for sector-specific filtering.
    - **Changes**: Created and populated with sector mapping data.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    - **Summary**: The main React component, responsible for routing, global state management, and rendering the core application layout and features.
    - **Changes**:
        - Initial setup: Basic routing and layout.
        - Core AI features: Integrated API calls to backend, displayed analysis results, added Live alerts toggle.
        - Search and Add stocks: Added UI for stock search input and watchlist management.
        - Authentication: Implemented Login/Signup dialogs, state management for JWT, Axios interceptors for auth headers.
        - Profile: Added Profile dialog for LLM settings (provider, model, API key), Telegram settings.
        - Google Login: Added Continue with Google button and logic to handle OAuth redirect.
        - Persistence: Switched from  to  for JWT, LLM settings, and UI preferences (watchlist, timeframe, market, live_alerts).
        - Strategy Builder: Integrated the Strategy Builder UI with filters (risk, horizon, asset classes, RSI, prompt, top N), later locking to Stocks only and India only.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug: after login profile setting is not working not found message is getting. The user reported this issue after the Google login functionality was implemented and fixed. The AI engineer attempted to resolve this by modifying  (Chat Messages 352, 354). However, this led to a  (Chat Message 356) at a line within the  endpoint, indicating a problem with how the router or handler was defined or included. The last observed action (Chat Message 358) shows the  file content, highlighting the syntax error. The current state of the product is that Google login is implemented, but accessing the user profile after authentication is failing due to this backend error.
